# Space-Maker-PRO
## Introduction

What is Space Maker PRO?

In short:

A 4 band sidechain controlled dynamic, 4 band parametric EQ plugin.

In more details:

Space Maker originally created based on Mix Space VST developed by Mannix. However, the similarity with the Space Maker PRO is ending here.
This VST is a 4 band parametric EQ, where each band controlled by precisely filtered and maintained sidechain data. Each band can be switched on and off without losing configured parameters. If you wish, you can change the gain individually for each bands to more precisely finetune the effect of the actual band. The VST is completely transparent when no sidechain data applied, or no band configured, etc... The attenuation only takes in place when the sidechain data reaching the threshold.
